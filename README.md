# My Personal Notes and Journey to Learn Tiny Renderer from Scratch

## Base Setup

It's recommended to start with the provided source code to understand the full process from the ground up. By setting up the base environment, you can learn everything step by step. Here's how to set up the base code:

1. **Clone or Copy the Source Code**  
   Copy the source code into your project directory.

2. **Set Up CMake**  
   Create a `build` directory and generate the necessary build files using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. **run the program:**  
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
4. **Expected Output:**   
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see an output file named *output.tga* with a red dot in the center.
